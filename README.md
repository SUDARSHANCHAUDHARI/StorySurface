## Why This Exists

Story experiences can feel richer when the interface changes with tone, pacing, and scene state. StorySurface explores that reading surface before adding model-backed generation and persistence.

## Key Technical Decisions

**Mock generation keeps the first demo focused on experience.** The UI can demonstrate flow, tone, and branching before adding real AI generation.

**Static Next.js output is enough for launch.** The prototype does not need server state yet, so Cloudflare Pages can host it as a public demo.

**The README labels generation honestly.** Users should know the current branching/generation is a demo concept, not a production story engine.

## Features

- prompt-led mock story flow
- scene progression
- lightweight branching choices
- tone and beat presentation
- responsive reading stage

## Run Locally

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Release scope | Public demo |
| Framework preset | `Next.js` |
| Build command | `pnpm build` |
| Build output directory | `out` |
| Node version | `20.19.6` |

## Verification

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
```

## Known Limits

- Story generation is mock behavior.
- No persistence or saved stories yet.
- No audio, media, or creator export workflow yet.

## About

I'm Sudarshan Chaudhari, a Senior Quality Engineer, Test Automation specialist, and AI systems builder based in Bangkok, Thailand.

I have 13+ years of experience in software quality engineering, working across SaaS, fintech, gaming, web, mobile, cloud, and digital signage platforms. My background combines hands-on test automation with QA leadership, test strategy, CI/CD, release quality, production investigation, and cross-platform validation.

Alongside my professional QA career, I run [SudarshanTechLabs](https://sudarshantechlabs.com/), my independent engineering and product lab where I design, build, test, and ship software across Android, web, AI, cybersecurity, developer tooling, and cross-platform applications.

### What I work on

- ⚙️ **Quality Engineering & Test Automation** — Playwright, Selenium, Cypress, Appium, API testing, automation frameworks, end-to-end testing, CI/CD, release gates, GitHub Actions, risk-based testing, and production validation
- 🤖 **AI Systems & Automation** — AI agents, multi-agent orchestration, MCP servers, AI-assisted QA, prompt tooling, developer workflows, automation systems, and Claude Code plugins
- 📱 **Mobile & Cross-Platform Applications** — Android applications built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, Google Play releases, automated build and publishing pipelines, and cross-platform development spanning iOS, web, Windows, and macOS
- 🌐 **Web Applications & Platforms** — Full-stack applications using Next.js, TypeScript, Firebase, Cloudflare, REST APIs, and modern web infrastructure
- 🛠️ **Developer Tooling & CLI Engineering** — Rust, Python, TypeScript, CLI utilities, multi-repository tooling, build automation, release tooling, and engineering productivity systems
- 🛡️ **Cybersecurity & Observability** — Threat detection, log analysis, security auditing, vulnerability assessment, monitoring, and security-focused developer tools
- 📺 **Digital Signage & Device Platforms** — Content validation, playback testing, device compatibility, production investigation, monitoring, and QA across diverse hardware and operating-system environments

My work sits at the intersection of quality engineering, automation, AI, and software development. I approach products with a QA mindset from the beginning: understanding failure modes, designing for testability, automating repetitive work, and building release confidence into the engineering process.

Through SudarshanTechLabs, I also build products and tools from idea to production, covering architecture, development, testing, CI/CD, release automation, monitoring, and ongoing maintenance.
